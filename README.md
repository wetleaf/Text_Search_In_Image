# **Text Search In Image**
## **Introduction** 

Sometimes, It is difficult to search for a piece of information in an image with multiple text with different size,font,gradient,orientation. Unlike pdfs, we can not auto-search for these content in the image. This Project aims to convert the image into a pdf with copyable text at the same loaction in the image.  

Example:

![image ](delhi_metro_map.jpg )

This is a Delhi Metro Map. People do strugle to get the desired location in the map.


## **How is it helpful?**
1. **Easy Search:** Searching through image with full of content 
2. **Storage:** Documents can be stored in form of images (less space and easy to upload)
3. **Evaluation:** Handwritten text can be converted into pdf for auto-evaluation 
4. **Alter Text:** Text font can be changed as per convience of user. Changing color of text helps color blind people to see the text.
5. **Disoriented Text:** Identifying Disoriented or Distorted text.
